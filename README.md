## Introduction

DMLogger is replacement for standard OS X's NSLog() logging method.
It was created to make a log debugging routine more simple, more informative and faster than it currently is with NSLog.

It allows you to set a default level of logging (trace,debug,info,warning,error or fatal) and print out only interesting message based on your application development stage.
Logging messages can be simple (no timestamp, only your text) or detailed (you can pick your timestamp format, show or hide called method, line number and class name).

It can also override default NSLog message and stript it from application's release build.
